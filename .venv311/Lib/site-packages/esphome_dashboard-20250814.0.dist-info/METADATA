# ESPHome Dashboard

The ESPHome Device Builder is a user facing dashboard embedded in ESPHome. It allows users to easily create and manage their configurations.

This repository contains the JavaScript frontend and is embedded in ESPHome releases.

## Development

Check out this repository, run `npm install` and then run

```
npm run develop
```

It will start the dev server and will automatically re-bundle updated JavaScript (except for the `static` folder).

Then run ESPHome in dashboard dev mode by defining the relative path from the ESPHome repository to this dashboard repository as the environment variable `ESPHOME_DASHBOARD_DEV`.

```
ESPHOME_DASHBOARD_DEV=../dashboard esphome dashboard ./
```
